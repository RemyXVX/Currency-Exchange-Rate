## Step by step breakdown on how to run application: ##
<br>

**copy by running:**

````
**I would recommend also setting up work envirnoment after cloning by:**
```
npm init -y
```
**then:**
```
npm install
```
From there you should get your own API key from [ExchangeRae-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) to then apply it onto project. Don't forget to make  <big>**.env**</big> file to protect all import keys!!!
```
touch .env
